# **Simple Tax**
<br></br>
## Objective
---
<br>

- The government of Simpleton has devised what it thinks is an easy income tax system, but its citizens still need help. They have commissioned you to write a program to ask a citizen a few simple questions and compute the tax that is payable or the refund that is due. You must write your program as clearly as possible so that the government can verify it easily. Your program should first ask a citizen for his/her income (`income`), housing cost (`houseCost`), number of children (`totalChildren`), and number of children that are in school (`schoolChildren`). It should then compute and print the tax payable or the refund due. The tax rules are as follows. The Simpleton tax rate is 18% but citizens are not taxed on the first $10 000 of income unless they pay more than $8 000 for housing. For every child, a Simpleton citizen gets a $500 tax reduction, or $1 000 if the child is in school. This reduction never results in citizens getting refunds unless their housing costs are less than $6 000 and they have more than two children, at least one of whom is in school. Finally, if the tax payable is more than <br> $2 000, then it is increased by an additional 15% surtax.
